This is a simple Todo List app that I built as a part of my learning process for modules and EJS templates.

The app uses Node.js, Express, and EJS. It allows the user to add new items to their Todo list and also create separate work-related lists.

- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to use the app

## Features

The app has the following features:

- Add new items to your Todo list
- Create separate work-related lists
- View items in your list(s)
- Delete items from your list(s) (cross them out when checked)
- The app also uses EJS templates to display the Todo lists dynamically.
